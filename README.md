# Ludo-feature

Use feature_extractor.py for extracting the feature of markers in 1v1 Ludo game. These features can be further be used to train a machine learning model for playing Ludo autonomously. The output is a multiclass classification problem to decide which marker to move based on the feature vector.  

I have uploaded some sample dataset which i created manually trainX contains the feature vector and trainy contains the correct marker to move based on the feature vector.

Use Untitled.ipynb to train the model. Currently trained using random forest.
